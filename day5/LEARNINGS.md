## Day 5: Introduction to Machine Learning

In Day 5, I learned the basic and core concepts of Machine Learning. This session helped me understand how machines learn from data and how different learning types are used in real-word problems. Along with technical learning, I also practiced explaining concepts in simple words.

## Types of Machine Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. This means input and output both are already known. The model learns from examples and then predicts for new data. Examples include email spam detection and house price prediction.

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. In this type, the model finds hidden patterns or groups in data without knowing the output. It is commonly used in customer segmentation and anomaly detection. This learning is more about exploring data.

Reinforcement learning is based on trial and error. An agent interacts with an environment and learns from rewards or penalties. If the action is good, it gets reward, otherwise punishment. It is used in game AI, robotics, and recommendation systems.

## Regression vs Classification

Regression is used when we want to predict continuous values like house prices, temperature, or sales. It answers the question “how much”.

Classification is used when we want to predict categories like spam or not spam, disease or healthy. It answers the question “which class”.

Understanding the difference between regression and classification made many ML problems more clear to me.

## Decision Tree Learning

A decision tree works like human decision making. It uses conditions to reach a final decision. It has a root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes. I implemented a simple loan approval system using if-else conditions which helped me understand how decision trees work internally.

Decision trees are easy to understand and can be used for both classification and regression problems.

## Practical and Research Learning

I wrote simple Python programs to simulate decision tree logic and regression vs classification examples. I also researched machine learning concepts from ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and one article. Each source explained concepts in a different way which improved my understanding.

## Communication and Soft Skills

I practiced explaning regression and classification using real-life examples. This helped me improve my communication skills and confidance. I realized that explaining technical concepts clearly is very important for an AI engineer.

## Reflection

This day helped me build a strong foundation in machine learning concepts. I learned not only theory but also how to apply and explain it. Overall, this session improved both my technical and comunication skills.
