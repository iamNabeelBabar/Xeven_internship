# Day 4: Operators & Type Conversion

**Date:**20-01-2025

**Focus:** Logical, comparison, arithmetic operators, type conversion, operator precedence

## 1. Practical Work Completed

### Login System

- Validated **username, password, and age** using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Printed **specific error messages** for each failed condition
- Handled **invalid numeric input** for age using `try-except`
- Learned to **collect multiple errors and report them together**
- Built a structure that is **extensible for future validations**

### Multi-Operation Calculator

- Supported arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- Applied **type conversion** (`int()`, `float()`) on user input
- Handled **division/modulus by zero** and invalid operation selection
- Formatted float results to **2 decimal places** for readability
- Practiced **error handling and input validation**

### Operator Precedence Notebook

- Demonstrated **order of operations**: `() > ** > * / % > + -`
- Showed how **parentheses override precedence**
- Combined **type conversion with arithmetic** for accurate results

## 2. Key Learnings

- **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not` can be used to validate multiple conditions simultaneously
- **Type Conversion:** Always ensure inputs are converted to the correct numeric type before arithmetic
- **Operator Precedence:** Complex expressions require careful use of parentheses to enforce correct evaluation
- **Error Handling:** `try-except` blocks are essential to catch input errors and prevent crashes
- **Debugging Practice:** Identified type-related errors systematically and corrected them
